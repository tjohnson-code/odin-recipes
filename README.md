This project is a simple recipe website to show my progress through The Odin Project.
There's not a lot of detail, as this was just about inserting images and links into the website.
I also demonstrated the ability to make ordered and unordered lists.

I searched the internet for a few pictures and recipes, as this is just an example for coding purposes.
Credit for the alfredo recipe and image goes to delish.com
Credit for the BBQ ribs recipe and image goes to heygrillhey.com
Credit for the California burger recipe and image goes to burgerartist.com
I may have made some minor tweaks to the recipes, but the majority of credit goes to them.

For V2 - I added div's, id's, and classes, I also styled the website using things I've learned from TOP/knew previously.
